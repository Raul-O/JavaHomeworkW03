Implement a bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of SalesRepresentative objects in descending order. The sorting should be done based on the amount of revenue generated via sales. Each rep has a number of sales, and a quota / sale.  After the sorting, the first object should be the rep with the most revenue generated. The last object in the array should be the rep with the least revenue generated.
